# User Management Screen - User Interface Specification

## Requirements

The user management screen is a part of the application's admin module and is used to manage user accounts. The following requirements should be fulfilled:

1. Display a list of all users with their relevant details.
2. Allow administrators to add new users.
3. Allow administrators to edit existing user details.
4. Allow administrators to delete user accounts.
5. Provide search and filtering capabilities to find specific users.
6. Implement pagination to handle a large number of users efficiently.

## User Interface Components

### User List

- Display a table listing all users.
- Columns: User ID, Name, Email, Role, Last Login, Actions.
- The table should be sortable by each column.
- Provide a search input field to search for users by name or email.
